## Installation
Download the develop folder and open the terminal at the develop level. Once here, run the json script "npm run test". This will run the Cypress tests in the cypress folder, and then in the components folder and the e2e folder. Let the tests run, and upon completion they should show the test with all green checks as passing. 

## Usage
This is open to anyone looking to understand a bit more about Cypress and how tests work and how to build them. Feel free to fork this repo and manipulate the it to fit your own needs!

## Test
With the terminal open at the develop level, run the script "npm run test" to try this for yourself. Node modules will need to be download beforehand if they were not already. To install all necessary node modules, at the develop level run the script "npm install".
